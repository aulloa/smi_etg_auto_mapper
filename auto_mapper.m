%% So the issue here is that the image and points are not mathcing up 
% because this is not the same point corresponding to the image, to correct
% this issue we have to determine the point this image came from - 
% More importantly how do we figure out statistically if this system can be
% trusted. We cannot go through every fram in this and manuall measure,
% even then we cannot do it for all negating the point, so we have to
% create a representative sample, that we are %confident the rror is within
% this range. Doing this across many different image will give us a gauge
% of the error in the automatic mapping system. On the other hand there
% should be test cases run to catch errors on the other side. For example
% how do we make sure we don't incorrectly mapped samples in our data set?
% If the mapping system fails it will most likely fail largegly due to the
% non localized form of error. That is to say failure will result from the
% object recogniziton softeware and can fail by matching far away points in
% an image. thus allowing large descrepencies. how do we catch those,
% implement another object reconginition code, which recognizes how far
% away the point is from the cross. This will potentially bring up false
% alarms but may bring up bad data sets, will it amplify error?
