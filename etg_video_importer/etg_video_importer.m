%   etg_video_importer imports videos taken by SMI's eye tracking glasses
%   into matlab
%   
%   The .avi videos produced by the etg system needs to be uncompressed
%   before importing to matlab

%----Inputs----
% input_file_name  = string name of video
    % etg_video_importer is built to use .avi videos saved by the SMI etg
    % system directly. It also though has been tested using .mp4 videos
    % which held trimmed etg videos.
    
%----Output----
% video = a 4D matrix holding 3D image data in an array
% uncompressed video will be saved to your current directory

%----Dependencies----
% Uses the ffmpeg toolbox version 2.2 found on matlab exhange and can be
%   installed using the "Add-Ons" Toolstrip in matlab
% The toolbox requires ffmpeg to be installed, then run the toolbox setup
